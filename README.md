# Task-6
Contact Form with JavaScript Validation
This project is a simple Contact Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes client-side validation to ensure that all input fields are properly filled before submission. The form contains Name, Email, and Message fields. The Name field accepts only letters and spaces, the Email field is validated using a regular expression to ensure correct format, and all fields are required. If any input is invalid, appropriate error messages are displayed below the respective fields. Upon successful validation, a success message is shown without refreshing the page. This project is created as a frontend practice task to demonstrate form handling and input validation using JavaScript.
